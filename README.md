Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the designing, development and maintenance of software systems.
Its important in the technology industry as it promotes scalability, efficiency, security, productivity, quality and reliability of software systems


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. 1950s Early Programming and Assembly Language- Early computers required direct manipulation of hardware and programming was done by scientists
2. 1960s Structured Programming and High Level Language- High level languages such as COBOL were introduced
3. 1970s Warterfall Model and Requirements- Was a structured approach with sequential stages
4. 1980s Object-Oriented Programming- The OOP allowed developers to model real-world entities promoting reusability and scalability
5. 2020s Artificial Intelligence- AI and machine language has been integrated to automate tasks and create intelligent systems


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning- Define the project's goal and requirements
2. Design- Develop architecture, data models, interface and system components
3. Implementation- Write the actul code
4. Testing and debugging- Errors in the code are determined and are corrected
5. Deployment- The system is made available to the users
6. Documentation and Maintenance


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall follows a linear and sequential approach in which each phase is completed before moving to the next one, an example is a software for a school set up. Agile uses an iterative and incremental
approach where the project is divided into small modules, an example is an ecommerce company


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer; Develops the actual system by coding
Quality Assurance Engineer; Ensures the software meets the right standard and quality
Project Manager; Monitor the project and ensure they are completed in time and within scope


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Debugging and Error handling- Developers can debug codes within the same environment for example in pycharm, a software developer uses in built debugger
Integration with Tools and Framework- Developers can work seamlessly with their chosen technologies for example, Android Studio allows developers to build apps with tools like Gradle and SDK tools



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Changing Technology- This makes it difficults for developers to keep up as some software may get outdated, the solution is continous learning and professional development
2. Code Security- Codes may be vulnerable to risks and unauthoried access, solution is to include stratic and dynamic security analysis tools


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing- Testing individual components of the system. This helps to identify early errors that may occur
2. Integration Testing- Involves testing multiple components of the system. Helps to verify the interaction between modules and reduce integration issues
3. System Testing- Tests the entire system. Helps to confirm that the entire system functions properly
4. Acceptance Testing- Ensures the system meets the specified requirements. Helps to validate the software will fulfill the objectives and user needs


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the designing, refining and optimizing prompts given to AI models. Its important as it improves accuracy of responses and reduces ambiquity


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt:Develop a website
Improved prompt: Develop a website that allows users to enter sessions using login details
The improved vague is effective as it describes in details the use of the website
